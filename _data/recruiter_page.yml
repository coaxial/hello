faq:
  - q: Tell me about your experience.
    a: I am a software engineer with 10 years experience. I have worked
        with companies of all sizes in Canada and Switzerland, taught and
        mentored students learning to program, and consulted on software
      quality, testing, and delivery improvements.
  - q: Which technologies have you worked with?
    a: >-
      In order of proficiency:
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript (which is the language TypeScript, NodeJS, React,
        Angular, VueJS, and every frontend web framework uses)</li>
        <li>Ruby (although it's been a while)</li>
        <li>Golang</li>
      </ul>

  - q: What are you looking for in your next role?
    a: >-
      I am looking for a company whose software is a core product (as opposed
      to a cost center), where technical skill and code quality are first class
      citizens, where issues and bugs are fixed before working on new features,
      and where we aren't constantly fire-fighting. I am also looking for a
      good work/life balance: i.e. overtime is never expected and only very
      rarely (once or twice a year at most) necessary.
