      "Hazel for hackers" – A gem to keep your filesystem tidy by periodically
      running custom rules.<br>
      I became the maintainer for this gem as its current author doesn't have
      as much time to work on it anymore. I have so far updated the code to
      work with Ruby 2.7 and 3+, configured automation for testing and
      releasing, triaged the backlog of issues. <a
