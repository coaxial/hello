  <p>As business owner, entrusting a third party with building your vision can
    be nerve-racking: what if they can't deliver? What if the project is late
    and goes over-budget? What if it fails after dozens or hundreds of
  thousands have been spent on it? What if the result doesn't match your
  expectations?</p>
  <p>Most freelancers will sit with you for 30 minutes or an hour, ask what it
    is you want, and send you a statement of work detailing which technologies
    and languages they're going to use, along with a bunch of boilerplate terms
    and conditions. It is not totally clear to you how using ASP.NET rather
    than Ruby will help you close more sales. You pick the lower quote
    because at least if it fails, you won't lose as much money. The freelancer
    will then disappear for a few weeks or months and emerge with software that
    doesn't quite meet your expectations. Unfortunately it's too late to make
    any changes, and you're out
of patience anyway.</p>
  <p>Does it ring a bell? If so, I'm sorry and can only empathize. But it
    doesn't have to be this way!</p>
  <p>What if you could trust the person you hired to do the job well?</p>
  <p>What if you could be confident that the investment you are about to make will pay back several times over what it cost and net a positive return?
  </p>
  <p>What if you could see and use the most recent version of the software while
    it is getting built?</p>
  <p>What if you could launch earlier?</p>
  <p>What if you could see how much the project will impact your profits and whether it makes sense to build it beforehand?
  <p>Does it sound too good to be true? Then you're in for a treat! I follow a
    carefully designed process that ensures you are getting the best return on
    your investment, and that you are never left in the dark for weeks on
  end.</p>
  <p>Before I can write a proposal, we will spend a few hours together so I can
    understand your business, what your goals are, and why are you considering
    this project. We will figure out exactly how to meet your objectives, what
  it takes for the project to be successful, and how much value the project
  would add to your business.</p>
  <p>While the project is getting built, you will have access to the current
    version of the software so you can test-drive it. At regular intervals
    (usually every week or two), I will present the new fatures that have been
  completed during that period. We will make sure that we are still on track
  and on budget for the completion of the project.</p>
  <p>And after the project is delivered, I can help you make sure everything is
    backed up, that the servers are patched, up to date, and report on your
    conversion rates.</p>
  <p>It is possible to have a pleasant and stress-free experience with a
    software consultant: this is what I do!</p>
  <p>I'd love to hear about your
    project, <a href="/contact">get in touch</a> and let's see how we can make your business even more successful!<p>
